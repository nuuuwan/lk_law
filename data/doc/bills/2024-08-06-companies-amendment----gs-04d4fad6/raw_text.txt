person  who  ultimately  owns  or
controls ten per cent or more of a

through,  direct  or  indirect
ownership or control of shares or
voting rights or other ownership
interest in that company, and also
includes  a  natural  person  who
exercises  effective  control
through  other  means,  and
beneficial  ownership  is  to  be
construed  accordingly;

“effective control” includes a situation
where  control  is  exercised
indirectly either through a chain
of ownership or by appointment
or removal of a director or by any
other  means  of  indirect  control,
such as the ability to take strategic
decision that affects the operation
of  the  company,  its  business
practices or general direction of
the company.”.
