(c) by  reason  of  a  change  in  the  ownership  or  occupation  of

the  land  after  the  granting  of  the  wayleave,  ceases  to  be

binding  on  the  owner  or  occupier  of  the  land.

(2)  The  owner  or  occupier  of  the  land  may  in  a  case  falling

within  paragraph  (1)-

(a) at  any  time  after  or  within  three  months  before  the  end  of

give  to  the  licensee  a  notice  requiring  the  licensee  to  remove  the

electricity  line  from  the  land.  However,  the  licensee  shall  not  be

obliged  to  comply  with  such  a  notice  except  in  the  circumstances  and

to  the  extent  provided  by  the  following  provisions  of  this  paragraph.

period,  or  in  the  case  of  subparagraph  (b),  at  the  end  of  the  period  of

one  month  beginning  from  the  date  of  the  Regulator’s  decision  or

such  longer  period  as  the  Regulator  may  specify.

(4)  In  this  schedule  “wayleave”  in  relation  to  a  land  means

such  interest  in  the  land  as  consists  of  a  right  of  a  licensee,  to  install

and  keep  installed,  an  electricity  line  on,  under,  or  over,  that  land  and

to  have  access  to  that  land  for  the  purpose  of  inspecting,  maintaining,

adjusting,  repairing,  altering,  removing  or  replacing  such  electricity

line.

6.  (1)  This  item  applies  where  any  tree  is  or  will  be  in  such

close  proximity  to  an  electricity  line  or  electrical  plant  which  has  been

installed  or  is  being  or  is  to  be  installed  by  a  licensee  as-

(a)

to  obstruct  or  interfere  with  the  installation,  maintenance

or  working  of  the  line  or  plant;  or

(b)

to  constitute  an  unacceptable  source  of  danger  (whether

to  children  or  to  other  persons),

and in this item the “land” means the land on which the tree is growing.

(2)  The  licensee  may  give  notice  to  the  occupier  of  the  land

requiring  such  occupier  to  fell  or  lop  the  tree  or  cut  back  its  roots  so

as  to  prevent  it  from  having  the  effect  mentioned  in  subparagraph

(a)  or  (b)  of  paragraph  (1),  subject  to  the  payment  to  such  occupier

by  the  licensee  of  the  expenses  reasonably  incurred  by  such  occupier

in  complying  with  the  requirements  of  the  notice.

(3)  Where  the  occupier  is  not  also  the  owner  of  the  land,  a

copy  of  any  notice  under  paragraph  (2)  shall  also  be  served  on  the

owner.

notice  under  paragraph  (5),

the  licensee  may cause the tree to  be felled  or  lopped  or  its  roots  to  be

cut  back  so  as  to  prevent  it  from  having  the  effect  mentioned  in

subparagraph  (a)  or  (b)  of  paragraph  (1).

(5)  If,  within  twenty  one  days  from  the  giving  of  a  notice

under  paragraph  (2),  the  owner  or  occupier  of  the  land  gives  a

counter  notice  to  the  licensee  objecting  to  the  requirements  of  the

notice,  the  matter  shall,  be  referred  to  the  Regulator.

(6)  On  a  reference  to  it  under  paragraph  (5),  the  Regulator

may  after  giving  the  parties  an  opportunity  of  being  heard  by  a

person  appointed  by  it,  may  make  such  order  as  it  thinks  just,  in  the

circumstances  and  any  such  order-

(a)

  may  allow  the  licensee  (after  giving  such  notice  to  any

person  by  whom  a  counter  notice  was  given  of  the

commencement  of  the  work  as  the  order  may  direct)  to

cause  the  tree  to  be  felled  or  lopped  or  its  roots  to  be  cut

back  so  as  to  prevent  it  from  having  the  effect  mentioned

in  subparagraph  (a)  or  (b)  of  paragraph  (1);  and

(b) may  determine  any  question  as  to  what  expenses  (if  any)

are  to  be  paid  to  the  licensee  by  the  owner  or  occupier.

hedges  and  growing  crops;

(b) cause  the  felled  trees,  lopped  boughs  or  root  cuttings  to

be  removed in accordance with the directions of the owner

or  occupier;  and

(8)  In  this  item,  “tree”  includes  any  shrub,  and  references  to

“felling”  and  “lopping”  shall  be  construed  accordingly.

7.  (1)  Where  the  Regulator  is  satisfied  that  any  immovable

property  is  required  for  the  purposes  of  carrying  on  the  activities

which  a  licensee  is  authorised  to  carry  on  by  its  licence,  or  for  the

purposes  of  discharging  any  function  assigned  to  such  licensee  by

this  Act  and  that-

the  licensee  has  made  all  reasonable  efforts  to  negotiate

the  acquisition  of  such  property  with  the  owner  of  the

property;  and

the  Regulator  may  recommend  to  the  Minister  that  the

immovable  property  be  acquired  under  the  Land  Acquisition

Act  (Chapter  295)  and  transferred  to  the  licensee.

(2)  Where  the  Minister,  by  Order  published  in  the  Gazette,

approves  the  proposed  acquisition  of  the  immovable  property  specified

in  the  recommendation  of  the  Regulator  made  under  paragraph  (1),

purpose  and  may  accordingly  be  acquired  under  the  Land  Acquisition

Act  (Chapter  295)  and  transferred  to  the  licensee.

property  under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  (Chapter  295)  for  a  licensee

shall  be  payable  by  that  licensee.

(4)  The  Regulator  shall  not  recommend  the  acquisition  of  any

immovable  property  under  paragraph  (1)  if  such  immovable

property  is  being  used  by  another  licensee,  to  whom  it  belongs  for

the  purpose  of an installation necessary for carrying on of the activities

which  the  licensee  is  authorised  by  its  licence  to  carry  on  or  is

proposed  to  be  used,  within  a  period  of  five  years,  by  such  other
