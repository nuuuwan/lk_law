the appellant or his authorized representative fails to attend
at the time and place fixed for the hearing or any adjourned
hearing of the appeal, or if the appellant fails to attend in
person  when  required  so  to  attend  by  the  Commissioner-
General, the Commissioner-General shall dismiss the appeal:

time  after  the  dismissal  of  an  appeal,  satisfies  the
Commissioner-General  that  he  or  his  authorized
representative  was  prevented  from  due  attendance  at  the
hearing or at any adjourned hearing of such appeal by reason
of  absence  from  Sri  Lanka,  sickness,  or  other  reasonable
cause, the Commissioner-General may vacate the order of
dismissal  and  fix  a  time  and  place  for  the  hearing  of  the
appeal.

relating to or connected with or arising from such
appeal  and  referred  to  it  by  the  Commissioner-
General or the appellant; or

10

(b)

the  furnishing  of  any  document  or  the  taking  of

20

Social  Security  Contribution  Levy

or by registered post or by telegraph or electronic means so

default,  the  levy  for  relevant  quarters  within  five
years  only  to  be  selected  by  the  Commissioner-
General,  shall  rank  in  priority  to  any  lien  or
encumbrance created bona fide for value prior to
the date of default of such levy.

20

25

26. (1) Where any levy is in default, the Commissioner-

a notice in writing or by electronic means to the defaulter
stating  –

the assessment in respect of which such levy is charged, he
may, within thirty days of the date of such notice make any
objection  to  the  Commissioner-General  in  respect  of  the
levy  so  charged  and  the  Commissioner-General  shall
notwithstanding the provisions of section 34 consider such
objections  and  give  his  decision  thereon  which  shall  be
final.

27. (1) Where any levy is in default, the Commissioner-
General may issue a certificate to a Divisional Secretary, an
Assistant Divisional Secretary, a Fiscal, a Deputy Fiscal or a
levy  collector  containing  particulars  of  such  levy  and  the
name and address of the defaulter empowering the officer to
whom  such  certificate  is  issued  to  recover  or  required  to
cause the levy to be recovered from the defaulter named in
the certificate by seizure and sale of his movable property.

Recovery  of
levy  by
seizure  and

(2)  The  seizure  referred  to  in  subsection  (1)  shall  be
effected in such manner as the said officer shall deem most
expedient in that behalf and any property so seized shall be
kept for seven days at the costs and charges of the defaulter.
If the defaulter fails to pay the said levy in default together
with the costs and charges within the said seven days, the
Divisional Secretary, the Assistant Divisional Secretary, the
Fiscal, the Deputy Fiscal or the levy collector, as the case
may  be,  shall  cause  such  property  to  be  sold  by  public
auction.

(3) The sum realized by the sale shall be applied –

30

and any balance shall be paid to the defaulter.

(4) Where the Commissioner-General is of the opinion
that  recovery  of  any  levy  by  the  means  specified  in
subsection (2) is impracticable or inexpedient, he may submit
a certificate to the District Court having jurisdiction in the
district where the defaulter resides or in which any property
movable or immovable owned by the defaulter is situated,
containing such particulars of levy and the name and address
of the defaulter, and the Court shall thereupon issue a writ of
execution  to  the  Fiscal  authorizing  and  requiring  him  to
seize  and  sell  all  or  any  of  the  property  movable  and
immovable of the defaulter or such part thereof as he may
deem necessary for recovery of the levy, and the provisions
of  sections  226  to  297  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  shall,
mutatis mutandis, apply to such seizure and sale.

15

(5) For the purposes of this section, “movable property”
shall include plant and machinery whether fixed to a building
or not.

28. (1) Where the Commissioner-General is of the opinion
in any case that recovery of levy in default by seizure and

of the levy in default has not been recovered, he may submit
a certificate containing particulars of such levy and the name
and last known place of business or residence of the defaulter,
to a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the division in which

Proceedings
for  recovery
before  a
Magistrate

(2)  (a)  The  Magistrate  shall  thereupon  summon  such
defaulter  before  him  to  show  cause  as  to  why  further
proceedings for the recovery of the levy should not be taken
against him.

30

35

(b) If sufficiant cause is shown, the levy in default shall
be  deemed  to  be  a  fine  imposed  by  a  sentence  of  the
Magistrate on such defaulter for an offence punishable with
fine  only  or  not  punishable  with  imprisonment  and  the
provisions  of  subsection  (1)  of  section  291  (except
paragraphs (a), (d) and (i) thereof) of the Code of Criminal

Social  Security  Contribution  Levy

23

Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, relating to default of payment
of a fine imposed for such an offence, shall thereupon apply,
and the Magistrate may make any direction which, by the
provisions  of  that  subsection,  he  could  have  made  at  the
time of imposing such sentence.

(c) Nothing in subsections (2) to (5) of section 291 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, shall apply
in any case referred to in this subsection.

(d) In any case referred to in this subsection, the Magistrate
may grant time for the payment of the fine in installments.

(3) Nothing in this section shall authorize or require the
Magistrate  in  any  proceeding  thereunder  to  consider,
examine or decide the correctness of any statement in the
certificate of the Commissioner-General or to postpone or
defer such proceeding for a period exceeding thirty days, by
reason only of the fact that an appeal is pending against the
assessment in respect of which the levy in default is charged.

(4)  The  Court  may  be  required  bail  to  be  given  as  a
condition precedent allowing time under subsection (2) for
showing cause for the payment of the fine and the provisions
of Chapter XXXIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,
No. 15 of 1979 shall apply where the defaulter is so required
to be given bail.

(5)  Where  payment  of  the  fine  is  directed  to  pay  in
installments under paragraph (d) of subsection (2) and default
is  made  in  the  payment  of  any  one  installment,  the  same
proceedings  may  be  taken  as  if  default  had  been  made  in
payment of all the installments then remaining unpaid.

authority of the defaulter and of all other persons concerned,
and shall be indemnified in respect of such payment against
all  proceedings,  civil  or  criminal,  notwithstanding  the
provisions of any written law, contract or agreement.

(4) Where any person to whom a notice has been given
under subsection (1), is unable to comply therewith owing
to  the  fact  that  moneys  in  question  do  not  come  into  his
hands or custody or become due from him during the period
referred to in subsection (2), he shall within fourteen days of

part  thereof  and  has  not  paid  over  as  required  by  the
Commissioner-General  the  amount  of  such  levy  or  part
thereof within fourteen days after the expiration of the period
referred to in subsection (2), such person shall, if he is an

be  recovered  from  such  individual,  secretary,  manager  or
other  principal  officer,  as  the  case  may  be,  by  all  means
provided for in this Act.

(6)  For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  the  expression
“defaulter” shall be deemed to include the agent of a person
who  is  in  default  and  the  provisions  of  this  section  shall
apply in any case where the levy which would have been
payable by any person if he were alive is in default, and for
the  purpose  of  the  application  of  these  provisions  in  any
such case, the expression “defaulter” in subsection (1)
