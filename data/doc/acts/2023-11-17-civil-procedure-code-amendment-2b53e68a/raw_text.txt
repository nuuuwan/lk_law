Civil Procedure Code (Amendment)
Act, No. 29 of 2023

15

objects  to  such  preservation,  disclosure  or
production from the source of such document for
not being reasonably accessible due to the burden
of  cost,  the  court  may  limit  the  extent  of  such
preservation,  disclosure  or  production  otherwise
allowed under the said subsections where –

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the preservation, discovery or production
sought  is  unreasonably  cumulative,
duplicative, disproportionate or excessive
to the material facts of the case;

the requested document in electronic form
can  be  obtained  from  any  other  source
which 
less
burdensome or less expensive;

is  more  convenient, 

the party seeking preservation, disclosure
or production has had ample opportunity
to obtain such document by discovery in
the action; or

the requested document in electronic form
is  irrelevant  or  not  proportionate  to  the
issues in dispute or the party’s resources
or the burden of expense of the proposed
discovery outweighs the possible benefits
and importance in resolving the issues:

Provided  however,  the  court  may  order
preservation,  disclosure  or  production  from  the
sources of such document in electronic form, if the
party  making  the  application  for  preservation,
disclosure or production is able to show good cause,
subject to such limitations as may be imposed by
the court.
